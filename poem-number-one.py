# In the garden of code,
# Where variables bloom like flowers,
sunrise = "start of a new day"

# We initialize our hearts with hope,
love = None

# As we walk through the branches of logic,
if sunrise and coffee and EB:
    # Embrace the light of opportunities,
    love = True

# We rev up our creative engines,
our_creation = []

# Noting that the creation is always in progress,
def is_done(creation):

# We find our voices,
def tell_story():

# And as the day unfolds,
while love:
    # We dance in the fields of creativity,
    create()

    # With every line, a story is told,
    tell_story()

    # Maybe some day... the creation will be done.
    # But for now we continue. Step by beautiful step.
    if is_done(our_creation):

# Let this poem fill your screen with magic
